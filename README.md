`slk` is a daily-driver replacement for the official Slack desktop client, built in Go with [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss).

## Why slk?

- **Fast.** Cold start in milliseconds. Render-cached messages. SQLite-backed scrollback. Real-time over WebSocket.
- **Tiny.** ~19 MB on disk. ~60 MB RSS for a live multi-workspace session vs. 500 MB–1.5 GB for the official client. No node_modules, no Chromium, no 1Gb RAM tax.
- **Keyboard-first.** Vim-style modal editing. `j/k`, `h/l`, `i`, `Esc`.
- **Pretty.** 59 built-in themes, lipgloss-styled panels, true-pixel avatars on kitty (half-block fallback elsewhere), emoji shortcodes, day separators, and pill-style reactions.
- **Multi-workspace.** All your workspaces stay connected in parallel. `1`–`9` to instantly jump between them, with live unread badges in the rail.
- **Yours.** TOML config, custom themes, custom channel sections via glob, XDG-compliant paths.

## Highlights

- Real-time messages, edits, deletes, reactions, typing indicators
- Inline images (kitty graphics / sixel / half-block fallback) with full-screen preview
- Threads side panel + a workspace-wide threads view
- Smart paste: clipboard images, file paths, or text — multiple attachments + caption in one send
- Slack-native sidebar sections, kept live; or glob-based config sections
- Automatic auth from the Slack desktop app — no tokens to copy, no Slack App required
- Vim-style modal keybindings, fuzzy channel finder, workspace picker
- 59 themes + drop-in custom themes, live theme switcher
- OS desktop notifications on DMs, mentions, and configurable keywords

## Quick install

**Homebrew** (macOS and Linux):

```bash
brew install --cask gammons/tap/slk
```

**Arch Linux** (community-maintained [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/slk)):

```bash
yay -S slk
```

**Go:**

```bash
go install -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath github.com/gammons/slk/cmd/slk@latest
```

For tarballs, `.deb` / `.rpm` / `.apk` packages, Windows, build-from-source, and the Homebrew formula→cask migration note, see the [Installation wiki page](https://github.com/gammons/slk/wiki/Installation).

## Setup

slk reads your session directly from the **Slack desktop app** — no DevTools,
no tokens to copy. Make sure you're signed in to the desktop app, then:

```bash
slk --add-workspace
```

slk lists the workspaces you're signed in to; pick the ones you want and
you're done.

Full walkthrough: [Setup wiki page](https://github.com/gammons/slk/wiki/Setup).

## Debugging

Set `SLK_DEBUG=1` to enable a comprehensive debug log written to
`slk-debug.log` in the current working directory. The file is
**truncated each run**, so reproduce the issue, quit slk, then copy
the file before relaunching. Log lines are categorized
(`[cache]`, `[imgfetch]`, `[imgrender]`, `[ws]`, `[general]`) so
`grep '\[cache\]' slk-debug.log` slices to one focus area.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A few ground rules:

- **AI-assisted PRs are accepted** — and in fact encouraged — but only if
  they're driven by a **frontier model** (e.g. Claude Opus, GPT-5,
  Gemini Pro) running with **high thinking effort**. Low-effort,
  small-model output that nobody reviewed tends to create more work than
  it saves, and will be closed.
- Ideally, drive the work with the
  [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) framework (or an
  equivalent skills/TDD-disciplined workflow). Brainstorm the design
  first, write tests, then implement.
- **For large feature additions, open an issue first.** Before sinking
  time into a big change, file an issue to discuss the idea and approach
  so we can agree on direction. Bug fixes and small improvements can go
  straight to a PR.
- Whether human- or AI-written, **you are responsible for your PR.**
  Understand the diff, make sure it builds and passes `go vet ./...` and
  `go test ./...`, and be ready to explain your choices in review.
- On a machine managed by [Santa](https://santa.dev), locally built Go
  binaries are killed on launch, so `go test` and the TUI itself must run
  through the docker wrappers in `tools/` — see
  [docs/developing-on-santa-hosts.md](docs/developing-on-santa-hosts.md).
