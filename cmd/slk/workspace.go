//
// all is guarded by mu because its writers and readers are on
// different goroutines. An earlier version of this comment said the
// map "is populated only during the connect-workspaces phase (before
// p.Run)" and so needed no mutex; that was wrong. run launches one
// connect goroutine per workspace and then calls p.Run immediately,
// so each goroutine's Add lands while the program is already handling
// messages -- including the WorkspaceReadyMsg of whichever workspace
// finished first, whose callbacks (EnsureSubscriptions, the rail's
// unread reader on every read-state event, later the workspace
// switcher) call ByID, and the wake watcher's All. Two workspaces
// finishing together, or one finishing while another's ready message
// is being handled, is a concurrent map write or read/write -- a
// runtime fatal, not a data race the detector merely reports -- and
// the window is exactly the boot phase, when every one of those
