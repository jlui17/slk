//
// Ordering: newest LastReplyTS first.

// Unread is computed from the subscription's per-thread LastRead
// (not the per-channel channels.last_read_ts): unread iff the newest
// activity is later than LastRead. "Newest activity" is the max of the
// authoritative latest_reply watermark (from subscriptions.thread.getView)
// and the newest locally-cached message in the thread, parent row
// included (a replyless parent is cached with empty thread_ts, and
// counting it lets a mark-unread on a parent-only thread survive a list
// reload) — so a subscribed thread with unread replies renders unread
// even when those replies have not been fetched into the cache yet (the
// boot case). The only suppression is the optimistic just-sent window: a
// locally-cached newest message known to be authored by self does not
// count as unread.
