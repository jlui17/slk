// the subscriptions.thread.getView fetch is triggered.
//
// Boot is a trigger because the socket replays nothing: an app that
// was closed (or asleep) for days missed every thread_subscription_
// changed event, and rendering the threads view from the days-old
// SQLite snapshot is the staleness this fetch fixes. Activation stays
// a trigger as a safety net. Collapsing both to one actual network
// sweep per workspace is the main-package gate's job
// (threadSubsGate) — the reducer deliberately fires unconditionally
// and stays dumb about throttling.
